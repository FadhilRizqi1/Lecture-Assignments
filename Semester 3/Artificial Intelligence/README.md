## Project Overview

This section details the individual assignments and projects within this folder.

### K-Means Clustering

**Description:** This Jupyter Notebook contains an implementation of the K-Means clustering algorithm. It demonstrates how to group data points into a specified number of clusters based on their features.

**File:** `Program/Ahmad_Fadhil_Rizqi_09031282328058_Clustering_KMeans_.ipynb`

### Naive Bayes Classification

**Description:** This Jupyter Notebook presents an implementation of the Naive Bayes classifier. It illustrates how to perform probabilistic classification, often used for tasks like text categorization or spam detection.

**File:** `Program/Ahmad_Fadhil_Rizqi_09031282328058_Klasifikasi_Naive_Bayes.ipynb`

### Datasets

The `Dataset/` folder contains sample CSV files used for testing and demonstrating the AI algorithms.
- `evaluation.csv`
- `evaluation1.csv`
- `evaluation5.csv`

## Technologies Used

* **Python**
* **Jupyter Notebook**
* **Pandas** (for data manipulation)
* **NumPy** (for numerical operations)
* **Scikit-learn** (for machine learning algorithms like K-Means and Naive Bayes)

## Setup Instructions

To run these Artificial Intelligence programs, you will need a Python environment with Jupyter Notebook and the necessary libraries installed.

1.  **Ensure Python is installed:** If you don't have Python installed, download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
2.  **Install Jupyter Notebook:**
    ```bash
    pip install notebook
    ```
3.  **Install required libraries:**
    ```bash
    pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn
    ```
4.  **Navigate to the AI project directory:**
    ```bash
    cd Semester\ 3/Artificial\ Intelligence/Program/
    ```
5.  **Launch Jupyter Notebook:**
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook
    ```
6.  Your default web browser will open a new tab with the Jupyter interface. You can then navigate to and open the `.ipynb` files to view, execute, and modify the code.
