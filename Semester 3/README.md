# Semester 3 - Foundational Studies & Projects

Welcome to the Semester 3 directory of my university assignments! This section of the repository encapsulates my foundational work in key computer science disciplines, primarily focusing on **Artificial Intelligence** and **Software Engineering**. It represents a crucial phase of my academic journey where core theoretical concepts were applied through practical projects and assignments.

## Semester Highlights

Semester 3 was instrumental in building a strong understanding of fundamental concepts in both AI and software development. Key highlights include:

* **Algorithmic Implementation:** Hands-on experience in implementing classic AI algorithms like clustering and classification.
* **Software Development Lifecycle:** Understanding and applying principles of software engineering through a practical web application project.
* **Database Design & Integration:** Learning to design and integrate relational databases into web applications.
* **Backend Development Basics:** Gaining proficiency in server-side scripting with PHP for web application logic.
* **Problem-Solving & Logic:** Developing analytical and logical thinking through diverse programming challenges.

## Featured Projects & Assignments

Hereâ€™s an overview of the main projects and assignment categories from this semester. Each entry provides a brief description and a direct link to its dedicated `README.md` for more in-depth information and specific setup instructions.

### 1. Artificial Intelligence Programs

**Type:** Practical Assignments - Artificial Intelligence
**Overview:** This section contains practical implementations of fundamental Artificial Intelligence algorithms. The focus was on understanding and applying core machine learning concepts such as data clustering (K-Means) and classification (Naive Bayes). These programs are developed using Python within Jupyter Notebooks, demonstrating the practical application of theoretical AI principles.

### 2. Ferigo (Travel Ticket Booking System)

**Type:** Project - Software Engineering
**Overview:** Ferigo is a web-based travel ticket booking system developed as a significant project for the Software Engineering course. This project provided hands-on experience in designing and building a functional web application from the ground up. It covers essential aspects of software development, including user authentication, managing travel schedules, ticket booking processes, and database integration.

## Common Technologies Utilized

The projects and assignments within this Semester 3 directory primarily leverage the following technologies:

* **Programming Languages:**
    * **Python** (for Artificial Intelligence projects, including libraries like Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn)
    * **PHP** (for server-side logic in web applications)
* **Web Technologies:**
    * HTML5
    * CSS3
    * JavaScript
    * MySQL (for database management)
* **Development Tools:**
    * Jupyter Notebook (for AI development)
    * Web Server Environment (e.g., XAMPP, WAMP, MAMP for PHP/MySQL projects)

## Getting Started (Local Development)

To set up and run any of the projects from this semester on your local machine, you will need the appropriate environment for each type of project:

1.  **Clone the main repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/FadhilRizqi1/Lecture-Assignments.git
    cd <your_repository_folder_name>/
    ```
2.  **Navigate into the specific project's directory** you wish to explore (e.g., `cd Semester\ 3/Artificial\ Intelligence/` or `cd Semester\ 3/Software\ Engineering/`).
3.  **Crucially, refer to the `README.md` file located within that specific project folder.** Each project's README contains detailed, step-by-step instructions for:
    * Installing necessary dependencies (Python libraries, web server setup).
    * Setting up any required databases (including importing `.sql` files).
    * Configuring project-specific parameters.
    * Accessing and running the project.
