## Project Overview

This collection of files represents practical assignments focused on core web programming concepts. They cover creating interactive forms, displaying data in tables, and handling basic server-side logic using PHP. These exercises are foundational for understanding how web applications process user input and display dynamic content.

## Files Included

-   `BiodataMHS.html`: An HTML file likely used to display student biodata, possibly in a structured format.
-   `form_data_diri.html`: An HTML form designed to collect personal data, demonstrating various input types and form submission.
-   `tabel_perkuliahan.html`: An HTML file showcasing data presented in a table format, possibly detailing course schedules or academic records.
-   `tabel_transaksi.php`: A PHP file that likely processes or displays transaction data, demonstrating server-side scripting for dynamic content generation, potentially interacting with a database (though no `.sql` file is present in this specific subfolder, it might be a standalone script or connect to an existing database).

## Technologies Used

* **HTML5**
* **PHP** (for `tabel_transaksi.php`)

## Setup Instructions

To run these practical assignments locally, you will need a basic web server environment with PHP support (e.g., XAMPP, WAMP, MAMP).

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/FadhilRizqi1/Lecture-Assignments.git
    cd <your_repository_folder_name>/Lecture-Assignments/Semester\ 4/Project\ Tengah\ Semester\ Praktikum\ Pemrograman\ Web\ 2/
    ```
2.  **Place the contents of this folder** into your web server's document root (e.g., `htdocs` for XAMPP). The full path should look something like `C:/xampp/htdocs/Project Tengah Semester Praktikum Pemrograman Web 2/`.
3.  **Access the files in your browser:**
    * Navigate to `http://localhost/Project%20Tengah%20Semester%20Praktikum%20Pemrograman%20Web%202/BiodataMHS.html`
    * Navigate to `http://localhost/Project%20Tengah%20Semester%20Praktikum%20Pemrograman%20Web%202/form_data_diri.html`
    * Navigate to `http://localhost/Project%20Tengah%20Semester%20Praktikum%20Pemrograman%20Web%202/tabel_perkuliahan.html`
    * Navigate to `http://localhost/Project%20Tengah%20Semester%20Praktikum%20Pemrograman%20Web%202/tabel_transaksi.php`
    * (Adjust paths as necessary based on your web server configuration and the exact file location).
