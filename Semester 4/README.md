# Semester 4 - Web Development & Practical Assignments

Welcome to the Semester 4 directory of my university assignments! This section of the repository is dedicated to showcasing my work primarily in **Web Programming** and related practical assignments. It reflects a significant phase of my learning journey, where theoretical knowledge was translated into functional web applications and practical coding exercises.

## Semester Highlights

This semester was focused on deepening my understanding of dynamic web development. Key highlights include:

* **Full-stack Web Application Development:** Building comprehensive web platforms from scratch, integrating front-end design with back-end logic and database management.
* **Database Integration:** Extensive use of MySQL for data storage, retrieval, and manipulation within web contexts.
* **User Management:** Implementing robust user authentication, authorization, and profile management systems.
* **Iterative Design & Development:** Experiencing the process of refining web applications through multiple design iterations.
* **Core PHP & HTML Proficiency:** Solidifying foundational skills in server-side scripting and structured web content.
* **Problem-Solving:** Tackling various programming challenges through weekly assignments and larger projects.

## Featured Projects & Assignments

Hereâ€™s a glimpse into the main projects and assignment categories from this semester. Each entry provides a brief description and a direct link to its dedicated `README.md` for more in-depth information and setup instructions.

## Common Technologies Utilized

The projects and assignments within this Semester 4 directory extensively leverage the following technologies:

* **Backend:** PHP, MySQL (for database management)
* **Frontend:** HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript
* **Frameworks/Libraries:**
    * Bootstrap (versions 4 & 5 for responsive design and UI components)
    * jQuery (for simplified DOM manipulation and AJAX calls)
    * Swiper.js (for carousels, notably in JUBEKA)
    * Font Awesome (for scalable vector icons)
    * Select2 (for enhanced select box functionality)

## Getting Started (Local Development)

To set up and run any of the web-based projects from this semester on your local machine, you will generally need a web server environment that supports PHP and MySQL (such as **XAMPP**, **WAMP**, or **MAMP**).

1.  **Clone the main repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/FadhilRizqi1/Lecture-Assignments.git
    cd <your_repository_folder_name>/
    ```
2.  **Navigate to the specific project's directory** you wish to explore (e.g., `cd Semester\ 4/Project\ Akhir\ Praktikum\ Pemrogaman\ Web\ 2/JUBEKA/`).
3.  **Crucially, refer to the `README.md` file located within that specific project folder.** Each project's README contains detailed, step-by-step instructions for:
    * Placing the project files in your web server's document root.
    * Setting up the necessary MySQL database (including importing `.sql` files).
    * Configuring database connection parameters.
    * Accessing the project in your web browser.
